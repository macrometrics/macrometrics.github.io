### Indian Growth is Not Overestimated: Mr. Subramanian You Got it Wrong
#### Ashima Goyal and Abhishek Kumar

Subramanian (2019) argues that indicators like growth in export, import and private credit can be used to predict economic growth across countries. He finds these indicators were able to predict Indian growth before 2011 but fail to do so after the GDP estimation methodology was changed in 2011. This implies Indian growth was overestimated by 2.5% per annum post 2011. But on removing various flaws in his data and procedures used, we find these indicators underestimate growth before 2011 too. The most reasonable specification suggests that the underestimation before 2011 was higher than underestimation post 2011. Moreover, growth in a large number of countries is found to be either overestimated or underestimated, based on these indicators. His empirical design is therefore flawed. These regressions cannot be used for predicting growth or for concluding Indian growth is overestimated or for pointing to problems in the estimation methodology.

### Aggregate Demand Management, Policy Errors and Optimal Monetary Policy in India
#### Barendra Kumar Bhoi, Abhishek Kumar and Prashant Mehul Parab

This paper evaluates the rule-based interest rate policy for India since 2000 Q1, which has become more relevant in the flexible inflation targeting (FIT) regime. Based on results of the reduced form Taylor-rule, we observed two episodes of possible policy errors since 2001. First, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, RBI brought down repo rate much below the level warranted by the Taylor rule that fueled inflation. Moreover, monetary policy tightening, followed thereafter, during March 2009 to June 2011 was insufficient in controlling prices. Second, despite favorable supply shocks, repo rate was above the rule-based policy rate during June 2013 to March 2016, leading to very high real interest rate. In the post-crisis period, we observed significant increase in the interest rate persistence, which could be attributed to RBIâ€™s reluctance to cut policy rate despite softening of inflation, leading to growth slowdown. Our results suggest that the optimal policy rate ranges from 4% to 5% for the last quarter of 2018. Actual repo rate at 6.5% in December 2018 was 150 to 250 basis points above the optimal rate. RBI has reduced repo rate by a cumulative 110 basis points since December 2018. As the negative output gap has widened and inflation remains subdued, there is scope to cut the repo rate further.

### Money and Business Cycle: Evidence from India 
#### Ashima Goyal and Abhishek Kumar

Abstract: In this paper we take a New Keynesian model with non-separable money in utility to Indian data using maximum likelihood. The identification problem in isolating the effect of money on output and inflation is solved by adjusting real balances for shifts in money demand. Estimates with an extended model with relevant features like partial indexation in prices, markup shock and time varying inflation target, show that real balances do affect output and inflation even after correcting for money demand unlike results for the United States and Euro-zone. A regression estimate and multivariate structural vector auto-regression give similar results. Types of money matter. Reserve money has the largest impact, pointing to the importance of the informal sector. The estimated income elasticity of narrow money is more than twice that of broad money, pointing to the dependence of firms on banks. Interest semi elasticity of money demand is close to one. Responsiveness of output to real interest rate is high. We find that interest rate setting is quite persistent. Coefficient of lagged interest rate varies from 0.71 to 0.95. We conclude that there is a significant asymmetry in the role of money in India (an emerging economy) in comparison to United States and Euro-zone (advanced economies).

### Over-reaction in Indian monetary policy
#### Ashima Goyal and Abhishek Kumar

Abstract: This paper explores challenges in implementing newly instituted inflation targeting in India. The evidence presented implies the aggregate demand channel is not weak in India. Supply side factors, however, remain important for inflation in contrast with advanced economies where in general inflation results from a demand shock. The rise and fall of inflation in the aftermath of the financial crisis closely followed supply shocks and thus can be attributed to bad and good luck respectively. Interest rate were increased to counter inflation originating from supply side that had significant output cost. An aggregate demand channel, which is stronger than expected, and inflation originating from supply shocks poses a significant challenge for the newly instituted inflation targeting regime.
