As mentioned in the previous section, since the early 1990s many OECD

central banks have adopted inflation targeting regimes for the conduct 

of their monetary policy. Broadly speaking, inflation targeting is defined as 

the official commitment of the central bank to the objective of achieving 

and maintaining the stability of the general price level. In practice, 

inflation targeting regimes are characterised by either explicit or implicit 

quantitative inflation targets, either intervals or point targets, where the 

centre of the interval or the point target currently varies across countries 

from 1 to 3 per cent per year. Under an inflation targeting regime 

monetary policy is carried out through the appropriate manipulation of the 

short-term nominal interest rate in an attempt to ensure that the desired 

inflation rate is realised.
